# Introduction

## Description

This game is a turn-based tactical RPG with the customizability of a trading card game. Survive, explore, and conquer a war-torn world, using parts from the robots you defeat to construct your own robot army. Whether you build a team of battlecruiser mechas or an exploding swarm of nanobots is up to you.

## Experience

The goal core player experience is of creative expression through designing the player's robots and accomplishment through protecting their creations via careful tactical battle. The game will achieve this by combining simple tactical low-variance gameplay mechanics with highly customizable robots which allow the player to change the rules of combat. Highly customizable robots give the player a sense of ownership over the game, while low-variance combat minimized the amount of "feel bad" moments where the player loses their creations.

## Gameplay

Player and enemy units exist on a procedurally generated hexagonal grid. The player engages enemy units in combat and gets rewards from defeating enemy units in the form of in-game currency and dropped upgrades. The currency is used to level up the player's units in the form of an increased number of slots to apply the acquired upgrades.

## Game Loop

Units take turns in a set turn order during which their owner decides which actions the unit performs. Actions may include attacking, charging up shields, or delaying the unit's turn in the turn order. The turn order is visible to the player so they can strategize with consideration to what actions will be available to them before enemy units take actions.

In order to prevent strategically changing a unit?s badge configuration between moves, which would be optimally strategic yet extremely tedious and unfun, units can only be edited at the beginning of the unit's turn.

## Combat Styles


## Offense-Defense Table

The three main defense categories are Armor, Shields, and Evasion. Armor passively reduces damage taken from an attack. Shields are one-time-use chargeable states which negate an attack. Evasion reduces the chance that an attack will hit the unit.

The tree main weapon categories are Railgun, Missile, and Laser. The Railgun is a weak, low energy cost weapon, good for making a large number of attacks per turn which can break through Shields but are ineffective at piercing Armor. Missiles are a medium strength, medium energy cost weapon, good for dealing large chunks of damage and getting through Armor but are inaccurate against evasive enemies. The Laser is a strong, high energy cost weapon with very high accuracy, good for hitting highly Evasive enemies but which are wasteful against shields.

Combined, these offensive and defensive abilities create the Offense-Defense Table.

|         | Armor   | Shields | Evasion |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Railgun | weak    | strong  | neutral |
| Missile | strong  | neutral | weak    |
| Laser   | neutral | weak    | strong  |

Note that while each of these weapons and defensive techniques have strengths and weaknesses, no direct bonus or penalty is calculated between the pair. The matchups are emergent to how the techniques work and are left to players to discover.

## Encouraging Strategic Diversity

As a roguelike, a key goal for the enjoyability of the game is replayability. To make replays enjoyable, it is necessary to make the player have multiple and diverse play styles they aspire to try out. Two separate challenges arise from this goal. The first is to make there be diverse play styles worth trying out, and the second is making the player aware of those possibilities.
